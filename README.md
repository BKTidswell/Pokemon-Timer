## How it works
This is a timer app that will allow you to collect and catch Pokemon. Completing any timer session of at least 15 minutes will allow you to receive candy or catch a Pokemon. Before starting a timer you can select a location which will change the Pokemon you are able to catch. 

## Candy
Candy is used to level up pokemon so that you can evolve them. There are two ways to get candy:
1. Select the "Candy!" button after finishing a timer to get 1 candy for every 5 minutes on the timer. (You still get 1 even if you choose "Catch!")
2. Release a pokemon. This gives you 1 candy for every 5 levels the pokemon has (rounded up)
