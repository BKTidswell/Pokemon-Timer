## How it works
This is a timer app that will allow you to collect and catch Pokemon. Completing any timer session of at least 15 minutes will allow you to receive candy or catch a Pokemon. Before starting a timer you can select a location which will change the Pokemon you are able to catch. 

## Candy
Candy is used to level up pokemon so that you can evolve them. There are two ways to get candy:
1. Select the "Candy!" button after finishing a timer to get 1 candy for every 5 minutes on the timer. (You still get 1 even if you choose "Catch!")
2. Release a pokemon. This gives you 1 candy for every 5 levels the pokemon has (rounded up)

## Pokemon Locations

The locations of all pokemon are the same as listed [here](https://www.serebii.net/pokemonsmile/pokemon.shtml) with the following changes:

* Pidgey, Pidgeotto, and Pidgeot have been moved from Mountain to Forest
* Spearow and Fearow have been moved from Mountain to Town
* Doduo and Dodrio have been moved from Mountain to Town
* Exeggcute and Exeggutor have been moved from Field to Forest
* Vaporeon has been moved from Town to Beach
* Flareon has been moved from Town to Volcano
* Omanyte and Omastar have been moved from Beach to Cave
* Aerodactyl has been moved from Mountain to Cave

* Nidorino -> Nidoking: lvl 36

## Troubleshooting
* On Windows, make sure that the save.ini file is with Pokemon Timer, and that Pokemon Timer has permissions to write to files
* On Mac, you will need to go into "Security and Privacy" to run the app as it is not approved by Apple. You may also need to set the "Sharing and Permissions" of the app (in the "Get Info" menu after you right click) so that all parties have read and write access in order for it to properly save Pokemon.

## Future Updates
* Get a reward after completing 15 minutes of a longer timer
* Save and show the amount of sessions you have done, total time worked, Pokemon caught etc.
* Export a list of sessions as a CSV
